view 1:
-left/right on bottom
-drag (use left/right while moving)
view 2:
-10 (or some reasonable number, i'll find out) buttons
-prefs page for programmable key buttons for this view
	\-> for each button, have a combo/drop-down that lists all the known button types.
	\-> maybe add modifiers.


-rotate view? (on the fly, or in preferences )

-server exit.. signal handle and close socket. (or just use SO_REUSEADDR or w/e that is )	

-mouse jumps a bit on initial movement..fix!
